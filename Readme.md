# Scheve

steve's scheme implementation!

Scheve is a scheme interpreter written in fsharp. It's pretty basic but useable enough for playing around with its repl. It was written as a learning project both to understand lisp evaluation better and to learn fsharp. In those goals is was very successfull.

It builds under mono 3.x on osx and probably other .net/mono setups.

Things missing:
* Lots of standard library functions
* Macros
* IO
